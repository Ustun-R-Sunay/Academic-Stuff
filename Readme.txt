Summary and comments for Program
----------------------
This program is meant to calculate the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
 g-factors in a system by considering the axial crystal field splitting (Dz),
 spin orbit coupling (LS), and non-axial crystal field splitting (Dx). 

To get the correct g-factors for the Mg defect in GaN (See Glaser et al.) 
the axial crystal field (Dz) must be negative and the g-factors are calculated 
using first order degenerate perturbation theory.
